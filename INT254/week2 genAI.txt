1.INTRODUCTION TO NEW INFORMATION TO LLM

Here are some key notes summarizing the video:

- Large language models lack access to information beyond their training data and cut-off point.
- To incorporate new information into prompts, simply include it at the beginning of the prompt.
- Examples include providing data on birds outside the house or introducing assumptions like a glass dome.
- The model can then use this information to reason and provide answers based on the input.
- It's crucial to provide enough context and any necessary rules for effective reasoning.
- New applications may involve searching databases, assembling prompts, and querying large language models.
- Introducing new information is done directly in the prompt without the need for retraining the model.

These notes highlight the importance of incorporating new information into prompts for large language models to effectively reason and provide accurate responses.

2.PROMPT SIZE LIMITATIONS

Sure, here's a summarized version of the text you provided:

- Prompts are crucial inputs to models like ChatGPT, but they have size limitations.
- Models can't process unlimited amounts of information at once, affecting prompt design.
- Users must select and prioritize information based on task relevance.
- Filters and summaries help fit information within prompt limits.
- Summarizing information helps preserve key details for reasoning tasks.
- Maintaining relevance and essential details is crucial in summarizing and filtering.

3.Prompts are a tool for rpeated use

Here are the summarized notes from the provided transcript:

- Viewing prompts as conversations rather than one-off interactions is crucial when working with large language models.
- Conversations allow for iterative refinement, akin to sculpting a masterpiece, where each interaction shapes the outcome.
- An example of conversational interaction involves seeking guidance on exploring a virtual lab for building robots.
- Through a series of prompts and responses, the user navigates through various steps, including defining the purpose, brainstorming concepts, and selecting components.
- Challenges such as generating diagrams or images are addressed by refining the conversation or seeking alternative solutions.
- The power of large language models lies in continuous engagement, asking follow-up questions, and problem-solving within the conversation.
- Iterative refinement and feedback are key to leveraging the full capabilities of these models.

4.ROOT Prompts
Here are the summarized notes based on the content provided:

- Prompts serve as essential rules that guide interactions with large language models.
- Root prompts, often hidden from users, define ground rules for model interactions, such as avoiding offensive content or prioritizing helpful output.
- Users can customize root prompts to set specific goals or constraints for model behavior.
- Root prompts influence subsequent conversation outcomes by providing rules that must be followed.
- Experimentation with root prompts can simulate different training data cut-off dates, affecting model responses to questions beyond a certain timeframe.
- Setting guardrails with root prompts is crucial to ensure appropriate model behavior and prevent circumvention by users.
- Root prompts allow for scoping and specialization of model interactions, defining rules and boundaries for specific topic areas or tasks.
