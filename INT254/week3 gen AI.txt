1.QUESTION REFINEMENT PATTERN
Here are the summarized notes based on the content provided:

- The question refinement pattern aims to improve interactions with large language models like ChatGPT by refining questions.
- Users prompt the model to suggest better questions based on its understanding of language patterns and topic contexts.
- The pattern involves instructing the model to suggest a refined question and asking the user if they want to use it.
- The refinement process helps clarify ambiguous or vague questions, providing more specific criteria and context.
- Users can reflect on the suggested questions to identify missing information or consider different aspects of the topic.
- This pattern encourages users to think more effectively about their questions and prompts, resulting in better outputs and understanding of the topic.

2.cognitive verifier pattern
Here are the summarized notes for the content provided:

- Large language models can often reason better by breaking down problems into smaller ones and explaining their thought process.
- The Cognitive Verifier pattern helps improve answers by instructing the model to generate additional questions to subdivide the original question.
- By breaking down the question, the model can tap into its knowledge base to identify relevant sub-questions and provide more accurate answers.
- The pattern also helps users structure their thinking by revealing additional dimensions to the problem.
- An example is provided where the model is asked about the number of mosquitoes in a front yard, and it generates relevant sub-questions like yard size, climate, time of year, presence of water sources, and vegetation.
- Users can provide answers to these sub-questions, and the model combines them to produce a final answer with more context and accuracy.
- While the model's output should be verified, the Cognitive Verifier pattern helps users understand the factors influencing the answer and prompts further exploration.

3.AUDIENCE PERSONA PATTERN
Here are the summarized notes for the content provided:

- The Audience Persona pattern complements the Persona pattern by instructing the large language model to produce output tailored for a specific audience.
- Instead of specifying rules for output, the Audience Persona pattern defines the audience persona, allowing the model to adjust its output accordingly.
- Examples demonstrate how the same topic, explaining large language models, can be presented differently based on the assumed audience persona.
- For instance, the model adapts its explanation for a layperson, Christopher Columbus, and a second grader who easily gets bored, each time altering the tone, language, and analogies used.
- By leveraging the Audience Persona pattern, users can obtain diverse and targeted outputs without needing to define specific output guidelines.
- This pattern enhances the model's capability to generate content suited to various audiences, making it a powerful tool for communication and education.

4.FLIPPED INTERACTION PATTERNS
Here are the summarized notes for the content provided:

- The Flipped Interaction pattern involves having the large language model ask questions to guide problem-solving or information gathering.
- It reverses the typical interaction, with the model asking questions and the user providing answers.
- Users can specify a topic and desired outcome, such as creating a fitness regimen based on fitness goals.
- The model asks questions until it has enough information to achieve the specified goal.
- This pattern is useful for scenarios where the user needs guidance, testing, or data collection, such as creating personalized plans or diagnosing issues.
- It leverages the model's knowledge and language patterns to generate relevant questions and responses, enhancing its effectiveness in guiding the interaction.
